/// <summary>
/// Regression guard for regulation voting v2 (#275): a career whose rules are historical never writes the
/// <c>regulations</c> section and keeps its results and state hashes exactly as they were before voting v2 existed.
/// The golden values were captured on main (commit 0d0f46d) without voting v2 (the same values come out of main and of this branch), with the same fixture (Balanced preset, 1955,
/// seed 7). Edit them only after a reviewed change to the day rules; this test prints the actual values and never writes them.
/// Re-pinned in #265 (people, contracts, staff, market): the staff roster changes (two race engineers per team, no strategist, chief mechanic or
/// commercial director on it), and a 1955 career's world contains its people, so its hash moves. The regulations are untouched.
/// Re-pinned again in #268 (sponsors): the sponsors section is schema 2 and sponsor amounts are scaled, so a 1955 career's hash moves.
/// Re-pinned again in #268 (academy, PP-069): the talent pool section moved to schema 2, juniors are recruited into an academy per team and the
/// programmes changed their speed-up; none of it touches the regulations.
/// Re-pinned again in #268 (infrastructure): a career pays its race travel from the ledger, so the season's transport share changes the state hash.
