/// Regression guard for regulation voting v2 (#275): a career whose rules are historical never writes the
/// <c>regulations</c> section and keeps its results and state hashes exactly as they were before voting v2 existed.
/// The golden values were captured on main (commit 0d0f46d) without voting v2 (the same values come out of main and of this branch), with the same fixture (Balanced preset, 1955,
/// seed 7). Re-pinned once for the academy of #268 (PP-069): the <c>talent pool</c> section moved to schema 2, juniors are recruited into an academy
/// per team and the programmes changed their speed-up; all of it changes the state hash of every career and none
/// of it touches the regulations.
/// Edit them only after a reviewed change to the day rules; this test prints the actual values and never writes them.
